# Blackboard

Blackboard is the codename for an application that will encourage people new to web development and programming in general to practise their skills.

Tutorials and lessons are valuable, but the best learning is self-driven and comes from practising what you know. Blackboard aims to provide a collection of projects for beginners, complete with in-depth specifications and advice.
